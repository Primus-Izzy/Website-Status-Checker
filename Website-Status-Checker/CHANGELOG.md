- **Development**: pytest, black, mypy, flake8, pre-commit

### Data Models

#### Status Categories
- **Active**: Website returns HTTP 200 (fully functional)
- **Inactive**: Website returns non-200 HTTP response (issues but reachable)
- **Error**: Connection, DNS, or SSL errors (completely unreachable)
- **Timeout**: Request exceeded timeout threshold (slow or unresponsive)
- **Invalid URL**: Malformed or invalid URL format

#### Error Categories
- **DNS Error**: Domain name resolution failures
- **Connection Error**: TCP connection failures
- **SSL Error**: SSL/TLS certificate or handshake issues
- **HTTP Error**: HTTP-level errors (4xx, 5xx responses)
- **Timeout Error**: Request timeout exceeded
- **Invalid URL Error**: URL format validation failures

### Use Cases Supported

#### Business Applications
- **Lead Validation**: Clean prospect databases by verifying website status
- **SEO Auditing**: Validate link integrity across large websites
- **Competitor Analysis**: Monitor competitor website availability and performance

- **Authentication**: No built-in support for authenticated endpoints
- **IPv6**: Limited IPv6 support (depends on system configuration)
- **Captcha**: Cannot handle websites with captcha protection

#### Performance Considerations
- **Network Dependency**: Performance heavily depends on network quality and latency
- **Target Server Load**: High concurrency may overwhelm smaller target servers
- **Memory Usage**: Very large datasets (1M+ URLs) may require memory optimization settings
- **DNS Rate Limits**: Some DNS servers may rate-limit high-frequency queries

### Breaking Changes from Pre-release
- This is the initial stable release, no breaking changes from previous versions

### Migration Notes
- **New Installation**: No migration required for new installations
- **Configuration**: All default settings are optimized for common use cases
- **Data Format**: Output format is stable and will maintain backward compatibility

### Security Considerations
- **SSL Verification**: Configurable SSL verification (can be disabled for broader compatibility)
- **User Agent**: Identifies itself as Website Status Checker (configurable)
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in respectful crawling to avoid overwhelming target servers
- **No Data Collection**: Tool does not collect or transmit any usage data

### Performance Optimization Tips

#### For Large Datasets (50K+ URLs)
```bash
# Recommended settings for large-scale processing
python src/cli.py large_dataset.csv \
  --concurrent 200 \
  --batch-size 2000 \
  --timeout 15 \
  --memory-efficient \
  --save-interval 5
```

#### For Maximum Speed
```bash
# Optimized for fastest processing
python src/cli.py input.csv \
  --concurrent 500 \
  --timeout 5 \
  --retry-count 1 \
  --active-only
```

#### For Maximum Reliability
```bash
# Optimized for reliability over speed
python src/cli.py input.csv \
  --concurrent 50 \
  --timeout 30 \
  --retry-count 3 \
  --include-inactive \
  --include-errors
```
